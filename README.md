## A CodeSpace template to experiment with GPT Labs' UPG AI-generated software development.

*This currently relies on an experimental fork of @gptlabs/upg cli tool to enable usage in codespaces and via SSH*

### Leverage `github-cli` to SSH and prompt for systems anywhere, anytime:
    ```
    gh auth login
    gh codespace ssh
    # choose your codespace
    ```
